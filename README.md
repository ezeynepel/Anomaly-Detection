# Modal Isolation Forest (MIF) - Internship Project

This repository contains a prototype implementation of the Modal Isolation Forest (MIF) algorithm, developed as part of my research internship at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

## Project Description

Modal Isolation Forest (MIF) is an extension of the classical Isolation Forest algorithm that integrates contextual modalities into the anomaly detection process. It aims to detect contextual anomalies in structured data such as time series.

This project includes:
- MIFTree construction using contextual split logic
- Anomaly scoring and visualization
- A simple ensemble approach (MIForest) for more robust detection

## Background

This work was carried out during my Erasmus+ internship in Summer 2025, focused on advancing anomaly detection techniques using modal logic.
